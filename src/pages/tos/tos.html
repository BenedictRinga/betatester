    14. Dispute resolution, arbitration
    <br>
    <br>
    We are very keen to resolve disagreements and also address any issues of concern to you quickly and amicably. Kindly contact us via email (info@mtrustq.com) or via Brag.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you are using the Services on behalf of a business (rather than for your personal use), you and mTrustQ Limited, mTrustQ Kenya Ltd. agree that to the extent permitted by law, all claims and disputes between us arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services will be finally settled under the LCIA Arbitration Rules, which are incorporated by reference into this clause. There will be one arbitrator (to be appointed by the LCIA), the arbitration will take place in London, and the arbitration will be conducted in English.

    <br>
    15. Exclusivity of jurisdiction
    <br>
    <br>
    You agree with mTrustQ that any litigation, in the event that we are unable to amicably resolve differences, shall be exclusively in the courts of England in the United Kingdom, unless this is prohibited by the laws of the country where you reside. You and mTrustQ Kenya Limited consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.
    <br>
    <br>
    16. Choice of law
    <br>
    <br>
    The laws of England and Wales govern these Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contractual or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter. The courts in some countries may not apply the laws of England and Wales to some disputes related to these Terms. If you reside in one of those countries, the laws of your home country may apply to those disputes.
    <br>
    <br>
    17. Severability
    <br>
    <br>
    If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these Terms and not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
    <br>
    <br>
    18. Additional terms for specific Services
    <br>
    <br>
    Given the breadth of our Services, we sometimes need to craft additional terms and conditions for specific Services. Those additional terms and conditions, which will be presented to you before you access the relevant Services, then become part of your agreement with us when you accept them. If any part of those additional terms and conditions conflicts with these Terms, the additional terms and conditions will prevail.
    <br>
    <br>
    19. Final terms
    <br>
    <br>
    These Terms make up the entire agreement between you and mTrustQ Kenya Limited and supersede any prior agreements.
    <br>
    <br>
    These Terms do not create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights.
    <br>
    <br>
    If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.
    <br>
    <br>
    We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
    <br>
    <br>
    You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent.
